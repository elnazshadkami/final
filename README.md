My project are bout recreat molude and generate it with CAD.traditional patterns are important because they are related to history. Still, they are in danger of being forgotten because drawing them- incredibly complex ones based on geometry- is very difficult and time-consuming. In this project, I decided to take one of those traditional patterns and recreate it using technical tools. My goal was to give the pattern a modern concept and bring it back to life while making the process easier with software. I used CAD for all the steps, including design and geometry. These patterns often had very complex geometry in the past. Still, the software can handle those calculations automatically through commands, so we no longer need to do hard geometric math

*Figure 1.

I recreated one of the traditional patterns in CAD. The original version was hand-drawn, and using CAD, I produced new generations of the pattern based on that design.

## Abstract
In this project I create geometric patterns that are symmetrical and reflect  along vertical (x=0) and horizontal (y=0) and diagonal axes. The concept is forming clay cup and paintings that they draw by hand and traditional. I created it on cad that is clear software for drawing geometric patterns with adding mathematical comments. All parents is generated from the concept. I want to show new geometric pattens that are so different and unique, but they are related to a basic pattern that is my concept and the relationship between traditional art and digital which is related to geometry and mathematical.

Islamic geometric patterns are important in art and architecture because they are an archetype and heritage for Iran [1]. I chose the pictures of clay cups and paintings in this book [2] and recreate and generate more. In the past, artists who drew geometric patterns relied on traditional tools such as the compass and set square rather than digital software. They spent more time on precise manual calculations and understanding geometric principles, making the process complex [1]. I recreated six traditional geometric patterns and used four axes that are in table A for making reflection [2]. I understood that CAD Computer-Aided Design software is used to increase the designer's productivity, improve the design quality, and create a database for manufacturing. CAD output is often electronic files for print or other manufacturing operations[3]. With CAD, I can draw shapes much faster and more efficiently than old tools like the compass and set square. One challenge is that digital patterns can lose the handmade feeling of traditional art that is part of our heritage and can be forgotten over time. However, CAD is a powerful tool because it makes design faster and more adaptable for different creative projects in the digital world.

## Methodology
[![4-comma][images-fig4]](https://example.com)

*Figure 4. I recreated the pattern from an image that was related to my concept. The main design was inside a square, based on the idea I had. The shapes look archaic, and the vertical,horizontal and diagonal axis (If BB' is L α. x + y = L ; (x,y) → (L - y,L - x) ) are arranged to keep the pattern centered.*
T4=F1∘F2∘F3 

F1: Reflection about X=0 

F2: Reflection about Y=0

F3:Diagonal reflection X+Y=L

*Figure 5. Figure 4.6 was used as the base to design a new repeating module. 
T5=F5∘F4∘F3∘F2∘F1 where:
F1: Reflection about X=0 

F2: Reflection about Y=0

F3: Reflection about X=0

F4: Reflection about Y=0

F5: Reflection about X=0  *

[![4-comma][images-fig6]](https://example.com)

*Figure 6.  used shape 4.8 to create a new module then apply transformations like reflecting. Each step adds more details.

*Figure 7.I selected shape 4.9.and used many times, with reflecting, rotations, and scale changes. The pattern grows more and more complex in every step. Red lines help to show how parts reflected along harizental and vertical axes. At the end (7.12), I get a finished shape inside a polygon border.

*Figure 8. The selected module was made using shape 7 (without rotation).then I reflected for some parts or all parts, and scaling. The steps show how the pattern becomes more complex. The red lines help to explain the reflection along vertical and horizental axes. In the last step (8.11), the final pattern is inside a polygonal frame.

My pattern is symmetrical, so i used CAD software-the best tool for drawing precise geometric shapes-to construct my pattern. I extended this symmetry operation by mathematical equation like reflecting, scaling, rotating based on the figure A formula.
 
I realized the main pattern was created in a square, so I drew a square by this point A, B, A', B' and drew a rhombus inside the square(figure 4.3) 
Arc is drawn from A center and R= AA1/2 (figure 4.4),
D1A1 is divided by 3, m, and n, draws a line perpendicular to the arc, and reflects so: 
T4=F1∘F2∘F3 
F1:(x,y)→(L−y,L−x)
F2:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F3:(x,y)→(x,−y)

Other shapes were generated from figure 4. Figure 5 is generated from figure 4.6 with reflecting so:
T5=F5∘F4∘F3∘F2∘F1
F1:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F2:(x,y)→(x,−y)
F3:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F4:(x,y)→(x,−y) 
F5:(x,y)→(−x,y)

Where:
1.	R:(x,y)→Rθ(x,y)R : (x,y) θ=35
2.	F1:(x,y)→(−x,y)
3.	S:(x,y)→(1.75x,1.75y)— Scaling by 75% enlargement
4.	F2:(x,y)→(x,−y)
5.	F3:(x,y)→(x,−y)
6.	F4:(x,y)→(x,−y)

Where:
1.	F1:(x,y)→(−x,y)
2.	F2:(x,y)→(x,−y)
3.	F3:(x,y)→(y,x) 
4.	F4:(x,y)→(−x,y)
5.	F5:(x,y)→(x,−y)
6.	F6:(x,y)→(−x,−y) 
7.	F7:(x,y)→(−x,y)
8.	F8:(x,y)→(x,−y)
9.	F9:(x,y)→(x,−y)
10.	F10:(x,y)→(x,−y)

Figure 9 is generated from 4.3 with scaling, reflecting and rotating so:
T9=S∘F1∘ F2∘ F3∘ R∘ F4∘ F5∘ F6∘ F7∘ F8∘ F9∘ F10∘ F11∘ F12∘ F13∘ F14∘

## Result and Future Work
In this project, based on the mathematical equation and one shape from traditional art, I recreated it with technical methods and generated five new generations that are completely unique but related to Figure 4. I wanted to show mathematical equations, which are the primary way to make geometric patterns because they are mostly symmetrical and based on them and using some software that is best for drawing mathematics, I can make more shapes in a short time. In traditional arts, people draw anything with hand details. Still, based on my mathematical command of CAD, like mirrors, I just drew half of the shapes because I reflected them on some exams that I mentioned, and they are created. Also, I tried mathematical command for the exact shape (figure 7,8) but changed the sequences for reflation axes, and the final shape is so different that they came from the same shape. Changing the mathematical axe sequences made the final shapes in Figures (7.13 and 8.11). I will use CAD to draw more axes to create precise, complex geometric shapes. Then, I will use Photoshop to turn the models into actual patterns with materials. It allows for flexibility and control when designing textures.

  <h3 align="center">Final assigment:  Darwinian Geometry: Evolving Forms in Space >

    
In this project, I got inspired by Darwin’s theory of natural selection. I started with a simple triangle and, in each step, I chose the shape that looked more complex and chaotic. At each stage, using a selection formula that weighs features like complexity, visual strength, and asymmetry, the best forms were chosen to move to the next generation. Finally, the selected shape was used as the main pattern to make the vase walls. This project is a combination of mathematical equation and visual design.

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
In this project, based on Darwin's theory of natural selection, I made a vase with some non-symmetrical, irregular, and visually strong triangles. Each vase wall is connected to other walls through these triangular forms. The process starts with a simple triangle, and at each level, some complex forms are selected. The final shape is designed to extend across four walls and create a strong composition on walls. This project aims to create and design a vase through geometric transformation inspired by Darwin's theory of natural selection and generate a complex form as a composition that exists within the vase's walls.

"As more individuals are produced than can survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence [1]. Based on Darwin's theory of natural selection, some traits can survive and are complex. [1]
"Triangles are the simplest polygon, yet they offer the highest flexibility for constructing complex surfaces" [2]. Most researchers have shown that the human brain responds strongly to complex and unpredictable forms [2].
This theory is my inspiration for this project. In place of living organisms, I use geometric forms to explore the same principles. I started with a triangle, which can potentially create complex shapes [3]. Also, the angles and the length can be changed, making it many unique triangles, but we have the same angles in other shapes like squares or rectangles. At each stage, I selected the more unpredictable and visually complex form rather than one that was simply symmetrical or orderly. For the production process, I use CAD for sketches, highly precise software for making patterns, and Photoshop to make visual patterns clear. I used SketchUp and 3ds Max to control lighting and textures for modeling, turning scientific theory into visual form. These tools, widely used since the 1980s, helped translate theory into form.

## Methodology
My process grows step by step, like Darwin’s idea. I choose shapes using A and W. I think good design shouldn’t feel too predictable, but it should make you think. That’s why I started with triangles. Their angles create unexpected, complex forms. Squares are too regular.

*Figure 4. I recreated the pattern from an image that was related to my concept. The main design was inside a square, based on the idea I had. The shapes look archaic, and the vertical,horizontal and diagonal axis (If BB' is L α. x + y = L ; (x,y) → (L - y,L - x) ) are arranged to keep the pattern centered.*

My pattern is symmetrical, so i used CAD software-the best tool for drawing precise geometric shapes-to construct my pattern. I extended this symmetry operation by mathematical equation like reflecting, scaling, rotating based on the figure A formula.
 
I realized the main pattern was created in a square, so I drew a square by this point A, B, A', B' and drew a rhombus inside the square(figure 4.3) 
Arc is drawn from A center and R= AA1/2 (figure 4.4),
D1A1 is divided by 3, m, and n, draws a line perpendicular to the arc, and reflects so: 
T4=F1∘F2∘F3 
F1:(x,y)→(L−y,L−x)
F2:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F3:(x,y)→(x,−y)

Other shapes were generated from figure 4. Figure 5 is generated from figure 4.6 with reflecting so:
T5=F5∘F4∘F3∘F2∘F1
F1:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F2:(x,y)→(x,−y)
F3:(x,y)→(−x,y) 
F4:(x,y)→(x,−y) 
F5:(x,y)→(−x,y)

Where:
1.	R:(x,y)→Rθ(x,y)R : (x,y) θ=35
2.	F1:(x,y)→(−x,y)

3.	F3:(x,y)→(y,x) 
4.	F4:(x,y)→(−x,y)

## Result and Future Work
In this project, based on the mathematical equation and one shape from traditional art, I recreated it with technical methods and generated five new generations that are completely unique but related to Figure 4. I wanted to show mathematical equations, which are the primary way to make geometric patterns because they are mostly symmetrical and based on them and using some software that is best for drawing mathematics, I can make more shapes in a short time. In traditional arts, people draw anything with hand details. Still, based on my mathematical command of CAD, like mirrors, I just drew half of the shapes because I reflected them on some exams that I mentioned, and they are created. Also, I tried mathematical command for the exact shape (figure 7,8) but changed the sequences for reflation axes, and the final shape is so different that they came from the same shape. Changing the mathematical axe sequences made the final shapes in Figures (7.13 and 8.11). I will use CAD to draw more axes to create precise, complex geometric shapes. Then, I will use Photoshop to turn the models into actual patterns with materials. It allows for flexibility and control when designing textures.

## Conclusion
In this project, based on the mathematical equation and one shape from traditional art, I recreated it with technical methods and generated six new generations that are completely unique but related to Figure 4. I wanted to show mathematical equations, which are the primary way to make geometric patterns because they are mostly symmetrical. Using some software that is best for drawing mathematics. I will use CAD to draw more axes to create precise, complex geometric shapes. Then, I will use Photoshop to turn the models into actual patterns with materials. It allows for flexibility and control when designing textures.

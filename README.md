  <h3 align="center">Final assigment:  Darwinian Evolution-Inspired Growth: A Geometric Vase >

    
In this project, I got inspired by Darwin’s theory of natural selection. I started with a simple triangle and, in each step, I chose the shape that looked more complex and chaotic. At each stage, using a selection formula that weighs features like complexity, visual strength, and asymmetry, the best forms were chosen to move to the next generation. Finally, the selected shape was used as the main pattern to make the vase walls. This project is a combination of mathematical equation and visual design.

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
In this project, based on Darwin's theory of natural selection, I made a vase with some non-symmetrical, irregular, and visually strong triangles. Each vase wall is connected to other walls through these triangular forms. The process starts with a simple triangle, and at each level, some complex forms are selected. The final shape is designed to extend across four walls and create a strong composition on walls. This project aims to create and design a vase through geometric transformation inspired by Darwin's theory of natural selection and generate a complex form as a composition that exists within the vase's walls.

"As more individuals are produced than can survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence [1]. Based on Darwin's theory of natural selection, some traits can survive and are complex. [1]
"Triangles are the simplest polygon, yet they offer the highest flexibility for constructing complex surfaces" [2]. Most researchers have shown that the human brain responds strongly to complex and unpredictable forms [2].
This theory is my inspiration for this project. In place of living organisms, I use geometric forms to explore the same principles. I started with a triangle, which can potentially create complex shapes [3]. Also, the angles and the length can be changed, making it many unique triangles, but we have the same angles in other shapes like squares or rectangles. At each stage, I selected the more unpredictable and visually complex form rather than one that was simply symmetrical or orderly. For the production process, I use CAD for sketches, highly precise software for making patterns, and Photoshop to make visual patterns clear. I used SketchUp and 3ds Max to control lighting and textures for modeling, turning scientific theory into visual form. These tools, widely used since the 1980s, helped translate theory into form.

## Methodology
My process grows step by step, like Darwin’s idea. I choose shapes using A and W. I think good design shouldn’t feel too predictable, but it should make you think. That’s why I started with triangles. Their angles create unexpected, complex forms. Squares are too regular.

I mirrored the chosen pattern on all four sides of the vase, creating continuous lines that connect the walls and give the form a unified, flowing appearance.

## Result and Future Work
This project reflects my ideas about transforming Darwin’s theory of natural selection into a visual design process. I created a process of visual evolution by starting with simple triangular forms and gradually selecting those that seemed more complex and unpredictable in each stage. The shapes were created through small structural changes. Each triangle had different angles, showing forms that looked unique, adapting, and becoming different. Each process of generation was about the logic of natural selection. It was not about being biologically strong but about looking strong and unique. These qualities decided which form could continue to the next level. Selecting the best form was connected to research, not my vision, that I believe the final product is improved; in the future, I plan to use eye-tracking to see how people react to the forms. I will make a small field study where participants look at a series of changing geometric shapes. Then, I can study the eye movement data to understand which forms get more attention and look stronger. It will help me choose shapes based on research and what people see and feel. It also makes the idea closer to natural selection, where survival depends on environmental feedback.


## Conclusion
This project taught me how to make a complex vase using simple shapes like triangles. The process starts with a simple triangle, and the complex form is chosen for the next step. Based on the research paper, I realized something unpredictable and chaotic is more complicated for the human eye. So, I defined some features of visual chaos and measured the level of chaos at each step. Each form that is high rank is a candidate for going to the next level. A memorable moment was when I made six generations and extended the final form for the vase walls.
